# M - Motor name
# ADDR - Axis number 0-7
# PREC - Precision of analog records
# SCAN - Scan period for monitor records.  Use passive when only epics will change value (default)
#      - Periodic scan will slow controller update performance (poller)
# MTRTYPE - motor type =
#       	0 - Servo
#		1 - Reverse servo
#		2 - High active stepper
#		3 - Low active stepper
#		4 - Reverse high active stepper
#		5 - Reverse low active stepper
# MTRON - motor off 0, motor on 1
